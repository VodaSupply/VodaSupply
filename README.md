A Cryptographic Representation Of Freshwater

Through reports produced by United Nations and SDG6, we calculated and scaled down the total remaining freshwater in earth and minted a token to represent it. 

Voda token burns are calculated using similar reports as a means to represent worldwide daily consumption of freshwater. The next two years of Voda supply represents the next 40 year lifespan of remaining freshwater in earth. At present, burns are completed manually as we are awaiting confirmation from UN to allow us access to pull from their repository and automate the burning calculations.

"Water scarcity is the lack of fresh water resources to meet the standard water demand. Water scarcity can also be caused by droughts, lack of rainfall, or pollution. This was listed in 2019 by the World Economic Forum as one of the largest global risks in terms of potential impact over the next decade." - World Economic Forum
